# Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
- Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is the field of learning an agentâ€™s objectives, values, or rewards by observing its behavior.

## Ng and Russell (2000): Algorithms for IRL

- Derive the condition of reward function R to be optimal in finite MDP
- Refer to [https://github.com/syyunn/apprenticeship_inverse_RL](https://github.com/syyunn/apprenticeship_inverse_RL) for an implementation of the paper over q-laerning on CartPole-v0
